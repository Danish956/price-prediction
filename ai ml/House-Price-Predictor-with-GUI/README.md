# [House-Price-Predictor-with-GUI](https://house-price-predictor-1.herokuapp.com/)
This project mainly focuses on predicting the house prices taking into account varying characteristics of the house like bathroom floors,
basement area,no. of floors, lot area, pin code etc. As all these features play a significant role in valuation of a house.  So , I envisioned 
an idea of creating a graphical user interface which was integrated with my machine learning model that can predict the house price. Since
the prediction should contain minimum errors. So , I had to preprocess my data in the dataset .  Through Graphical User Interface, A 
viewer can enter the required values for the features mentioned above through which a predicted house price is generated by the ML model(Linear Regression). 
This project was made keeping the objective in mind that if a person wants to buy/sell a house in a locality with some 
certain features then he/she can see the price of the house in that locality depending on the features mentioned by him/her  irrespective
of wherever they are whether be at home or travelling to some place.  Just by using their respective electronic devices such as smartphones
or laptops. They can get the required predicted price for the house they are interested in.

## Steps involved in the development of the project.
- Collection of data(Raw Housing Price) from kaggle.
- Implementation of Feature Engineering and Pre-processing on the dataset.
- Choosing the adequate Machine Learning Model.
- Training of the ML Model.
- Testing of ML Model for accuracy.
- Deployment of ML Model using Flask Framework and Heroku.

This is the User Interface of my project in this a user just need to enter some values of characteristics of the house and accordingly
the price of the house will be projected to the user, just by clicking "Predict Price" button.
